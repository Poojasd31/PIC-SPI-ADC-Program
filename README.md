# PIC-SPI-ADC-Program

📖 Overview
This program demonstrates how a PIC microcontroller communicates with an external ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) using the SPI protocol. The PIC acts as the SPI Master, sending commands to the ADC and receiving converted digital data.

🔹 Working Principle
The analog signal (e.g., from a sensor like temperature, potentiometer, etc.) is applied to the ADC input.
The PIC (Master) generates SPI clock (SCK) and sends control bits/commands to the ADC via MOSI.
The ADC converts the analog input into a digital value (e.g., 10-bit).
The ADC sends the digital data back to the PIC via MISO.
The PIC processes this data and can:
Display it on an LCD

SPI Pins in PIC
MOSI (SDO) → Sends command/data to ADC
MISO (SDI) → Receives converted data from ADC
SCK → Clock generated by PIC (Master)
CS/SS → Selects the ADC device

⚙️ Applications
Sensor data acquisition (temperature, pressure, light, etc.)
Digital control systems
Data logging with PIC
Interfacing external high-resolution ADCs (when PIC’s internal ADC is insufficient)
